abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) is an increasingly popular technology that
  enables physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc., to communicate and
  even interoperate with one another. It has been widely used in industrial
  production and social applications including smart home, healthcare, and
  industrial automation. While bringing unprecedented convenience,
  accessibility, and efficiency, IoT has caused acute security and privacy
  threats in recent years. There are increasing research works to ease these
  threats, but many problems remain open. To better understand the essential
  reasons of new IoT threats and the challenges in current research, this survey
  first proposes the concept of “IoT features.” Then, we discuss the security
  and privacy effects of eight IoT features including the threats they cause,
  existing solutions to threats, and research challenges yet to be solved. To
  help researchers follow the up-to-date works in this field, this paper finally
  illustrates the developing trend of IoT security research and reveals how IoT
  features affect existing security research by investigating most existing
  research works related to IoT security from 2013 to 2017.
