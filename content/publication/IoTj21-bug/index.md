abstract: In recent years, IoT platforms and systems have been rapidly emerging.
  Although IoT is a new technology, new does not mean simpler (than existing
  networked systems). Contrarily, the complexity (of IoT platforms and systems)
  is actually being increased in terms of the interactions between the physical
  world and cyberspace. The increased complexity indeed results in new
  vulnerabilities. This paper seeks to provide a review of the recently
  discovered logic bugs that are specific to IoT platforms and systems and
  discuss the lessons we learned from these bugs. In particular, 20 logic bugs
  and one weakness falling into seven categories of vulnerabilities are reviewed
  in this survey.
